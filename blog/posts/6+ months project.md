In October 2020, I started a (PHP)project with the Spotify Web API, it would be changed countless times as I progressed and learned along, but I somehow managed to release it on May the 24th.

There are countless things that I could have done better ... or not at all, but to sum up my experience spending such a long time with a side project, here's what I learned:

- **Be patient**

Even the smallest and easiest projects won't be achievable if you don't have the patience to sit through it.

- **Get used to reading the documentation(aka <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RTFM" target="_blank">RTFM</a>)**

It will somehow instill some discipline and independence(just enough) in you.

- **Not ironically, don't be scared to ask questions**

There's no way to grow and improve without asking questions, being open to other's thoughts and being vulnerable enough for people to give you some constructive criticism.

- **If in doubt, just do it**

There will always be a better implementation/pattern, but until you've found out about and learned it, do what you can.
